# Heart-Disease-Prediction

## About
This app is designed to help you make better and informed decision about your heart health. It is deployed with 3 different types of machine learning model:
* K - Nearest Neighbour Classifier (68% Accuracy)
* Naive Bayes Classifier (75.4% Accuracy)
* Logistic Regression (77.8% Accuracy)
  
to predict heart disease in a person.

## Dataset Description 
*Dataset Name*: Heart Disease Dataset

*Type of dataset*: Numerical Dataset

*Number of Rows*: 2518

*Number of Columns*: 14

*Count of Missing Values*: 2380

*Variables Present*:
* Age : age of the patient 
* Sex : gender of the patient (1=male and 0=female)
* Cp : chest pain in categories [0-3]
* Trestbps : Resting time systolic blood pressure in mm Hg
* Chol : Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl
* Fbs : Categorical variable to check whether the fasting blood sugar is greater than 120 mg/dl (1 = True, 0 = False)
* Rest_ecg : Resting electrographic results in categories [0-2] 

    0 = normal, 

    1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 
    
    2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
* Thalach : Maximum heart rate achieved in beats/min
* Exang : exercise induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
* Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment in categories [0-2] 
    
    0 = Downsloping 
    
    1=Flat 
    
    2=Upsloping
* Ca : Number of major blood vessels coloured by fluoroscopy in categories [0-4]
* Thal : Category for presence of thalassemia 
    
    0 = fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart) 
    
    1 = normal blood flow 
    
    2 = reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)
* Target : Categorical variable to show the presence of heart disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
